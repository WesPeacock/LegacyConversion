<body><h1>Encore2Unicode<br><small>version 6.1</small></h1><h2>Introduction</h2><p>Encore2Unicode is a command-line utility for Windows that can examine a font 
built using the SIL Encore font system and create a <span style="font-style: italic;" class="Em">draft</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> </span>
TECkit mapping table for converting data using that font to (and back from) 
Unicode. </p>
<p>Note that Encore2Unicode will not work with any other fonts than those built 
using the SIL Encore font system, version 3. It is also important to note that the 
mapping tables created are only drafts, and must be carefully reviewed before 
being entrusted with important data. </p><p>This
version of the Encore2Unicode package includes ver 1.3 of
the Encore2Unicode.exe program and the data files have been updated to
support Unicode 6.1.<br><br>Your use of this software is governed by both the&nbsp;<a href="#SIL_License">SIL International Freeware license agreement</a> and the <a href="#Unicode_Inc._License">Unicode, Inc., license agreement for Unicode data files and software</a>.
